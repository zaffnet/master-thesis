\noindent I take this opportunity to extend my greatest gratitude to those who have supported me throughout this journey.

\noindent Dr. Jonathan Rose, C.M.,\\
\indent I could not have asked for a better mentor. Our discussions and your honest critiques were instrumental in my development, not just as a researcher, but as an individual. You taught me the value of thinking and communicating clearly, and for that, I am forever grateful.

\noindent Ammi,\\
\indent Thank you for your endless encouragement and for being my biggest cheerleader from afar.

\noindent My brother, Aman,\\
\indent For your constant support and belief in me.

\noindent And my partner in life, Rueshan,\\
\indent This work would have been immeasurably less fulfilling and interesting without you. You made this a richer, more meaningful experience.

\noindent Lastly, to Allah, my Light and the Light of the Heavens and the Earth.
