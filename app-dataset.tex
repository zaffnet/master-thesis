\chapter{Overview of the Dataset}
\label{appendix:dataset_overview}


We are releasing the complete data from our feasibility study. Our dataset consists of a CSV file (\texttt{data.csv}), where each row corresponds to a unique participant. A total of 106 participants took part in the study. We also provide conversation transcripts between MIBot and participants in another CSV file (\texttt{conversations.csv}). All data provided by participants has been de-identified using the \texttt{spaCy}\footnote{\url{https://spacy.io/universe/project/scrubadub_spacy}} (version 3.8.4)
and \texttt{scrubadub}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/LeapBeyond/scrubadub}} (version 2.0.0) Python libraries. Further, the participants self-reported all the columns in the dataset (except for AutoMISC annotations).
