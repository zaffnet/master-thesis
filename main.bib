  abstract  = {This study aimed to investigate if and how chatbots can increase smokers’ intention to quit, specifically looking into the effectiveness of two communication styles (i.e., motivational interviewing (MI) and confrontational counseling (CC)) and the moderating role of individual differences (i.e., need for autonomy and perceived self-efficacy) that may affect smokers’ experience with the chatbot. In an online between-subjects experiment (N = 233), smoking participants were assigned to interact with either a MI chatbot (n = 121) or a CC chatbot (n = 112) for one 8-min session. Their need for autonomy and perceived self-efficacy were measured, as well as their satisfaction with the conversation and pre- and post-test intention to quit smoking. No significant effects of different communication styles were found regarding the outcomes, nor did the need for autonomy moderate these results. However, the effect of MI on user satisfaction was more profound among smokers with higher self-efficacy, and a positive effect of self-efficacy on user satisfaction appeared. Additionally, interacting with the chatbots about one’s smoking behavior significantly increased participants’ intention to quit, regardless of its communication style. As such, this study sheds light on the potential of conversational chatbots for smoking cessation interventions, as well as pathways for future research.},

Alcohol abstinence days and heavy drinking days were assessed monthly using a 30-day timeline follow-back procedure. RTC was assessed using 3 ‘readiness rulers’ (importance, readiness, and confidence to change, measured on a 0–10 visual analog scale). The effect of RTC on alcohol use over time was tested every 3 months using negative binomial generalized estimating equations (GEE), controlling for gender, age, baseline alcohol dependence severity and AUD treatment status (ongoing vs. ceased).GEE models showed highly significant effects of readiness and confidence to change on respective alcohol outcomes. Effects of importance to change were weaker.As hypothesized, higher RTC scores were associated with improved alcohol use outcomes in this longitudinal study. The strongest effects were for confidence to change. Finding significant predictive validity prospectively is consistent with a theoretical view of RTC as a dynamic construct. Further research might clarify how AUD treatment could actually elicit or increase RTC.},

  abstract = {Background. Empathy is a key aspect of the clinical encounter but there is a lack of patient-assessed measures suitable for general clinical settings.Objectives. Our aim was to develop a consultation process measure based on a broad definition of empathy, which is meaningful to patients irrespective of their socio-economic background.Methods. Qualitative and quantitative approaches were used to develop and validate the new measure, which we have called the consultation and relational empathy (CARE) measure. Concurrent validity was assessed by correlational analysis against other validated measures in a series of three pilot studies in general practice (in areas of high or low socio-economic deprivation). Face and content validity was investigated by 43 interviews with patients from both types of areas, and by feedback from GPs and expert researchers in the field.Results. The initial version of the new measure (pilot 1; high deprivation practice) correlated strongly (r = 0.85) with the Reynolds empathy measure (RES) and the Barrett-Lennard empathy subscale (BLESS) (r = 0.63), but had a highly skewed distribution (skew −1.879, kurtosis 3.563). Statistical analysis, and feedback from the 20 patients interviewed, the GPs and the expert researchers, led to a number of modifications. The revised, second version of the CARE measure, tested in an area of low deprivation (pilot 2) also correlated strongly with the established empathy measures (r = 0.84 versus RES and r = 0.77 versus BLESS) but had a less skewed distribution (skew −0.634, kurtosis −0.067). Internal reliability of the revised version was high (Cronbach's alpha 0.92). Patient feedback at interview (n = 13) led to only minor modification. The final version of the CARE measure, tested in pilot 3 (high deprivation practice) confirmed the validation with the other empathy measures (r = 0.85 versus RES and r = 0.84 versus BLESS) and the face validity (feedback from 10 patients).Conclusions. These preliminary results support the validity and reliability of the CARE measure as a tool for measuring patients' perceptions of relational empathy in the consultation.},

The Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) Measure has been developed as a tool for assessing the patients' perceptions of relational empathy in the consultation.Objectives. The present paper provides performance data on the CARE measure in a large sample of general practice consultations in areas of high and low deprivation.Methods. The CARE Measure was included in a self-completed questionnaire study involving 3044 patients attending 26 GPs in 26 different practices (16 in areas of high socio-economic deprivation and 10 in low deprivation areas, in the west of Scotland).Results. GPs and patients, in both high and low deprivation settings, endorsed the relevance of the CARE Measure. Overall, 76\% of patients rated the measure as being 'very important' to their current consultation. Higher rating of importance were observed in older patients, patients consulting with psycho-social problems, patients with long-standing illness or disability, and patients with significant emotional distress. Few patients rated individual CARE Measure items as being 'not applicable' to their current consultation; only 3.1\% of patients felt that more than 2 of the 10 items in the measure did not apply to their current consultation. Mean values were not influenced by deprivation, gender, reason for consulting, chronic illness, or emotional distress. Correlational analysis indicated that a sample size of 50 patients is sufficient to reliably estimate mean CARE score for an individual GP.Conclusions. These results indicate that the CARE Measure is considered by GPs and patients alike as being of direct relevance to everyday consultations in general practice, in both high and low deprivation settings. The measures is stable across patient groups and a reliable estimate of perceived GP empathy requires 50 completed questionnaires per doctor.},

We describe two conversational agent-based interventions to increase motivation and confidence to promote physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption that incorporate principles from motivational interviewing. We also explore the efficacy of constraining input, so users are only allowed to express change talk in their conversation with the agent. In a within-subjects experiment we demonstrate that both interventions are effective at increasing motivation, confidence, and self-efficacy for behavior change during a single counseling session. We also demonstrate that coercing user change talk leads to significantly greater increases in confidence compared to equivalent counseling agents that allow users to express statements about not changing their behavior.},

  abstract  = {Motivational Interviewing (MI) is defined as a collaborative conversation style that evokes the client's own intrinsic reasons for behavioral change. In MI research, the clients' attitude (willingness or resistance) toward change as expressed through language, has been identified as an important indicator of their subsequent behavior change. Automated coding of these indicators provides systematic and efficient means for the analysis and assessment of MI therapy sessions. In this paper, we study and analyze behavioral cues in client language and speech that bear indications of the client's behavior toward change during a therapy session, using a database of dyadic motivational interviews between therapists and clients with alcohol-related problems. Deep language and voice encoders, ie BERT and VGGish, trained on large amounts of data are used to extract features from each utterance. We develop a neural network to automatically detect the MI codes using both the clients' and therapists' language and clients' voice, and demonstrate the importance of semantic context in such detection. Additionally, we develop machine learning models for predicting alcohol-use behavioral outcomes of clients through language and voice analysis. Our analysis demonstrates that we are able to estimate MI codes using clients' textual utterances along with preceding textual context from both the therapist and client, reaching an F1-score of 0.72 for a speaker-independent three-class classification. We also report initial results for using the clients' data for predicting behavioral outcomes, which outlines the direction for future work.},

However, self-affirmation and defensive bias theories indicate that feedback may appear confrontational, especially when users are not motivated to incorporate them. We develop a feedback chatbot that employs Motivational Interviewing (MI), a directive counseling method that encourages commitment to behavior change, with the end goal of improving the user's conversational skills. We conduct a within-subject study with 21 participants in 8 teams to evaluate our MI-agent 'MIA' and a non-MI-agent 'Roboto'. After interacting with an agent, participants are tasked with conversing over videochat to evaluate candidate r\'{e}sum\'{e}s for a job circular. Our quantitative evaluation shows that the MI-agent effectively motivates users, improves their conversational skills, and is likable. Through a qualitative lens, we present the strategies and the cautions needed to fulfill individual and team goals during group discussions. Our findings reveal the potential of the MI technique to improve collaboration and provide examples of conversational tactics important for optimal discussion outcomes.},

  abstract  = {Behavior change is one of the most important goals in psychotherapy. This study focuses on Motivational Interviewing (MI), which is collaborative communication aimed at eliciting the client’s own reasons for behavior change. To investigate the effectiveness of facial information in modeling MI, we collected an MI encounter corpus with speech and video data in the nutrition and fitness domains and annotated client utterances using the Manual for the Motivational Interviewing Skill Code (MISC). By analyzing client answers to the questions after the session, we found that clients who expressed more Change Talk were more motivated to change their behavior than those who expressed less Change Talk. We then proposed RNN-based multimodal models to detect Change Talk by setting a 2-class classification task: "Change Talk" and "not Change Talk." Our experiment showed that the best performing model was a multimodal BiLSTM model that fused language and client facial information. We also found that fusing language and facial information as context achieved better performance than the unimodal and no-context models. Moreover, we discuss the label imbalance problem and conduct an additional analysis using turns as a unit of analysis. As a result, our best model reached F1-score of 0.65 for Change Talk detection.},

For example, large language models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other words, these models are not aligned with their users. In this paper, we show an avenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks by fine-tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written prompts and prompts submitted through a language model API, we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune GPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models InstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT models show improvements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while having minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets. Even though InstructGPT still makes simple mistakes, our results show that fine-tuning with human feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human intent.},

To further our understanding of the impact of scale on few-shot learning, we trained a 540- billion parameter, densely activated, Transformer language model, which we call Pathways Language Model (PaLM).We trained PaLM on 6144 TPU v4 chips using Pathways, a new ML system which enables highly efficient training across multiple TPU Pods. We demonstrate continued benefits of scaling by achieving state-of-the-art few-shot learning results on hundreds of language understanding and generation benchmarks. On a number of these tasks, PaLM 540B achieves breakthrough performance, outperforming the finetuned state-of-the-art on a suite of multi-step reasoning tasks, and outperforming average human performance on the recently released BIG-bench benchmark. A significant number of BIG-bench tasks showed discontinuous improvements from model scale, meaning that performance steeply increased as we scaled to our largest model. PaLM also has strong capabilities in multilingual tasks and source code generation, which we demonstrate on a wide array of benchmarks. We additionally provide a comprehensive analysis on bias and toxicity, and study the extent of training data memorization with respect to model scale. Finally, we discuss the ethical considerations related to large language models and discuss potential mitigation strategies.},

  abstract  = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated surprising performance on many tasks, including writing supportive messages that display empathy. Here, we had these models generate empathic messages in response to posts describing common life experiences, such as workplace situations, parenting, relationships, and other anxiety- and anger-eliciting situations. Across two studies (N=192, 202), we showed human raters a variety of responses written by several models (GPT4 Turbo, Llama2, and Mistral), and had people rate these responses on how empathic they seemed to be. We found that LLM-generated responses were consistently rated as more empathic than human-written responses. Linguistic analyses also show that these models write in distinct, predictable “styles”, in terms of their use of punctuation, emojis, and certain words. These results highlight the potential of using LLMs to enhance human peer support in contexts where empathy is important.}

We show how existing models trained on existing datasets perform poorly in this long-term conversation setting in both automatic and human evaluations, and we study long-context models that can perform much better. In particular, we find retrieval-augmented methods and methods with an ability to summarize and recall previous conversations outperform the standard encoder-decoder architectures currently considered state of the art.}

  abstract = {Background: The motivational interviewing (MI) approach has been shown to help move ambivalent smokers toward the decision to quit smoking. There have been several attempts to broaden access to MI through text-based chatbots. These typically use scripted responses to client statements, but such nonspecific responses have been shown to reduce effectiveness. Recent advances in natural language processing provide a new way to create responses that are specific to a client's statements, using a generative language model. Objective: This study aimed to design, evolve, and measure the effectiveness of a chatbot system that can guide ambivalent people who smoke toward the decision to quit smoking with MI-style generative reflections. Methods: Over time, 4 different MI chatbot versions were evolved, and each version was tested with a separate group of ambivalent smokers. A total of 349 smokers were recruited through a web-based recruitment platform. The first chatbot version only asked questions without reflections on the answers. The second version asked the questions and provided reflections with an initial version of the reflection generator. The third version used an improved reflection generator, and the fourth version added extended interaction on some of the questions. Participants' readiness to quit was measured before the conversation and 1 week later using an 11-point scale that measured 3 attributes related to smoking cessation: readiness, confidence, and importance. The number of quit attempts made in the week before the conversation and the week after was surveyed; in addition, participants rated the perceived empathy of the chatbot. The main body of the conversation consists of 5 scripted questions, responses from participants, and (for 3 of the 4 versions) generated reflections. A pretrained transformer-based neural network was fine-tuned on examples of high-quality reflections to generate MI reflections. Results: The increase in average confidence using the nongenerative version was 1.0 (SD 2.0; P=.001), whereas for the 3 generative versions, the increases ranged from 1.2 to 1.3 (SD 2.0-2.3; P<.001). The extended conversation with improved generative reflections was the only version associated with a significant increase in average importance (0.7, SD 2.0; P<.001) and readiness (0.4, SD 1.7; P=.01). The enhanced reflection and extended conversations exhibited significantly better perceived empathy than the nongenerative conversation (P=.02 and P=.004, respectively). The number of quit attempts did not significantly change between the week before the conversation and the week after across all 4 conversations. Conclusions: The results suggest that generative reflections increase the impact of a conversation on readiness to quit smoking 1 week later, although a significant portion of the impact seen so far can be achieved by only asking questions without the reflections. These results support further evolution of the chatbot conversation and can serve as a basis for comparison against more advanced versions.}

Objective: The development of chatbot prevention for eating disorders (EDs) is still in its infancy. Our aim is to present examples of and solutions to challenges in designing and refining a rule-based prevention chatbot program for EDs, targeted at adult women at risk for developing an ED. Methods: Participants were 2409 individuals who at least began to use an EDs prevention chatbot in response to social media advertising. Over 6 months, the research team reviewed up to 52,129 comments from these users to identify inappropriate responses that negatively impacted users' experience and technical glitches. Problems identified by reviewers were then presented to the entire research team, who then generated possible solutions and implemented new responses. Results: The most common problem with the chatbot was a general limitation in understanding and responding appropriately to unanticipated user responses. We developed several workarounds to limit these problems while retaining some interactivity. Conclusions: Rule-based chatbots have the potential to reach large populations at low cost but are limited in understanding and responding appropriately to unanticipated user responses. They can be most effective in providing information and simple conversations. Workarounds can reduce conversation errors.}

  abstract = {Background: The impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on health care workers' mental health, in particular, cannot be ignored. Not only did the pandemic exacerbate mental health challenges through elevated stress, anxiety, risk of infection, and social isolation, but regulations to minimize infection additionally hindered the conduct of traditional in-person mental health care. Objective: This study explores the feasibility of using Wysa, an artificial intelligence--led mental health app, among health care workers. Methods: A national tertiary health care cluster in Singapore piloted the use of Wysa among its own health care workers to support the management of their mental well-being during the pandemic (July 2020-June 2022). The adoption of this digital mental health intervention circumvented the limitations of in-person contact and enabled large-scale access to evidence-based care. Rates and patterns of user engagement were evaluated. Results: Overall, the opportunity to use Wysa was well-received. Out of the 527 staff who were onboarded in the app, 80.1{\%} (422/527) completed a minimum of 2 sessions. On average, users completed 10.9 sessions over 3.80 weeks. The interventions most used were for sleep and anxiety, with a strong repeat-use rate. In this sample, 46.2{\%} (73/158) of health care workers reported symptoms of anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 [GAD-7]), and 15.2{\%} (24/158) were likely to have symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-2 [PHQ-2]). Conclusions: Based on the present findings, Wysa appears to strongly engage those with none to moderate symptoms of anxiety. This evaluation demonstrates the viability of implementing Wysa as a standard practice among this sample of health care workers, which may support the use of similar digital interventions across other communities.}

The procedure essentially involves the construction of functions of the observed proportions which are directed at the extent to which the observers agree among themselves and the construction of test statistics for hypotheses involving these functions. Tests for interobserver bias are presented in terms of first-order marginal homogeneity and measures of interobserver agreement are developed as generalized kappa-type statistics. These procedures are illustrated with a clinical diagnosis example from the epidemiological literature.}

  abstract = {Objective: Motivational interviewing (MI) therapies are effective in reducing high-risk drinking in college populations. Although research supports efficacy of MI prevention strategies in reducing alcohol use, there are little data examining readiness to change (RTC), the underlying theoretical model of MI interventions. The purpose of the present study was to explore RTC variability and drinking behavior and whether MI increases RTC in an intervention group compared with controls. Method: Two-hundred eighty-five first-year female college students participated in the study. Present analyses focused on those students who consumed alcohol in the month before the study (n = 182). RTC was measured using the Readiness to Change Ruler. Results: Analyses were conducted using hierarchical linear modeling. There was significant variability in RTC: 71.86\% of variance in RTC was between-person differences, and 28.14\% was within-person differences. Higher RTC was associated with lower intentions to drink and future drinking behavior. However, in weeks in which students drank more, they experienced a decrease in RTC. Based on the significant cross-level interaction, the intervention group had significantly higher RTC than controls. Conclusions: These results provided partial support for our hypotheses. The overall theoretical construct of RTC varies both across and within individuals. These results also offer support for the utility of MI-based prevention strategies in increasing RTC within individuals. However, we did not consistently find that these changes related to drinking changes. Findings provide support for both the construct of RTC and utility of MI interventions in changing these beliefs in female college students. (J. Stud.

  abstract  = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful approach to enhance task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems. However, existing RL methods tend to mainly focus on generation tasks, such as dialogue policy learning (DPL) or response generation (RG), while neglecting dialogue state tracking (DST) for understanding. This narrow focus limits the systems to achieve globally optimal performance by overlooking the interdependence between understanding and generation. Additionally, RL methods face challenges with sparse and delayed rewards, which complicates training and optimization. To address these issues, we extend RL into both understanding and generation tasks by introducing step-by-step rewards throughout the token generation. The understanding reward increases as more slots are correctly filled in DST, while the generation reward grows with the accurate inclusion of user requests. Our approach provides a balanced optimization aligned with task completion. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively enhances the performance of TOD systems and achieves new state-of-the-art results on three widely used datasets, including MultiWOZ2.0, MultiWOZ2.1, and In-Car. Our approach also shows superior few-shot ability in low-resource settings compared to current models.}

  abstract  = {Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) plays an important role in Industry 5.0, improving worker well-being by automating repetitive tasks and enhancing seamless collaboration between humans and intelligent systems. In this context, Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems are a commonly used approach to enable natural communication in these settings, traditionally developed using rule-based approaches. However, the revolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) is changing how dialogue systems are being developed without the necessity of relying on tedious and rigid handcrafted rules. Despite their popularity, their application in industrial contexts remains underexplored, necessitating a solution to challenges such as hallucinations, lack of domain-specific data, high training costs, and limited adaptability. In order to explore the contribution of LLMs in the industry field, this work presents LAMIA, a task-oriented dialogue system for industrial scenarios that leverages LLMs through prompt tuning. This system has been adapted and evaluated for a bin-picking use case, using GPT-3.5 Turbo, showing to be an intuitive method for new use cases in Industry 5.0.}

  abstract       = {Research on the analysis of counselling conversations through natural language processing methods has seen remarkable growth in recent years. However, the potential of this field is still greatly limited by the lack of access to publicly available therapy dialogues, especially those with expert annotations, but it has been alleviated thanks to the recent release of AnnoMI, the first publicly and freely available conversation dataset of 133 faithfully transcribed and expert-annotated demonstrations of high- and low-quality motivational interviewing (MI)—an effective therapy strategy that evokes client motivation for positive change. In this work, we introduce new expert-annotated utterance attributes to AnnoMI and describe the entire data collection process in more detail, including dialogue source selection, transcription, annotation, and post-processing. Based on the expert annotations on key MI aspects, we carry out thorough analyses of AnnoMI with respect to counselling-related properties on the utterance, conversation, and corpus levels. Furthermore, we introduce utterance-level prediction tasks with potential real-world impacts and build baseline models. Finally, we examine the performance of the models on dialogues of different topics and probe the generalisability of the models to unseen topics.}

We reviewed 54 studies that prospectively examined this relationship. The relationship between SE and future smoking depended upon the population studied and the timing of the SE assessment. The relationship between SE and future smoking was modest when SE was assessed prior to a quit attempt; SE scores were .21 standard deviation units (SD) higher for those not smoking at follow-up than for those who were smoking. The relationship was stronger (.47 SD) when SE was assessed post-quit. However, this effect was diminished when only abstainers at the time of the SE assessment were included in analysis (.28 SD). Controlling for smoking status at the time of SE assessment substantially reduced the relationship between SE and future smoking. Although SE has a reliable association with future abstinence, it is less robust than expected. Many studies may overestimate the relationship by failing to appropriately control for smoking behavior at the time of the SE assessment.

This variability can substantially impact the quality of intervention that clients receive. However, there has been limited work to systematically evaluate the extent to which substance use intervention adherence varies from session-to-session, provider-to-provider, and site-to-site. The present study quantifies the extent to which adherence to Motivational Interviewing (MI) for alcohol and drug use varies across sessions, providers, and intervention sites and compares the extent of this variability across three common MI research contexts that evaluate MI efficacy, MI effectiveness, and MI training. Independent raters coded intervention adherence to MI from 1275 sessions delivered by 216 providers at 15 intervention sites. Multilevel models indicated that 57%–94% of the variance in MI adherence was attributable to variability between sessions (i.e., within providers), while smaller proportions of variance were attributable to variability between providers (3%–26%) and between intervention sites (0.1%–28%). MI adherence was typically lowest and most variable within contexts evaluating MI training (i.e., where MI was not protocol-guided and delivered by community treatment providers) and, conversely, adherence was typically highest and least variable in contexts evaluating MI efficacy and effectiveness (i.e., where MI was highly protocolized and delivered by trained therapists). These results suggest that MI adherence in efficacy and effectiveness trials may be substantially different from that obtained in community treatment settings, where adherence is likely to be far more heterogeneous.}

  abstract = {Background: In addition to addiction and substance abuse, motivational interviewing (MI) is increasingly being integrated in treating other clinical issues such as mental health problems. Most of the many technological adaptations of MI, however, have focused on delivering the action-oriented treatment, leaving its relational component unexplored or vaguely described. This study intended to design a conversational sequence that considers both technical and relational components of MI for a mental health concern. Objective: This case study aimed to design a conversational sequence for a brief motivational interview to be delivered by a Web-based text messaging application (chatbot) and to investigate its conversational experience with graduate students in their coping with stress. Methods: A brief conversational sequence was designed with varied combinations of MI skills to follow the 4 processes of MI. A Web-based text messaging application, Bonobot, was built as a research prototype to deliver the sequence in a conversation. A total of 30 full-time graduate students who self-reported stress with regard to their school life were recruited for a survey of demographic information and perceived stress and a semistructured interview. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed by Braun and Clarke's thematic method. The themes that reflect the process of, impact of, and needs for the conversational experience are reported. Results: Participants had a high level of perceived stress (mean 22.5 [SD 5.0]). Our findings included the following themes: Evocative Questions and Clich{\'e}d Feedback; Self-Reflection and Potential Consolation; and Need for Information and Contextualized Feedback. Participants particularly favored the relay of evocative questions but were less satisfied with the agent-generated reflective and affirming feedback that filled in-between. Discussing the idea of change was a good means of reflecting on themselves, and some of Bonobot's encouragements related to graduate school life were appreciated. Participants suggested the conversation provide informational support, as well as more contextualized feedback. Conclusions: A conversational sequence for a brief motivational interview was presented in this case study. Participant feedback suggests sequencing questions and MI-adherent statements can facilitate a conversation for stress management, which may encourage a chance of self-reflection. More diversified sequences, along with more contextualized feedback, should follow to offer a better conversational experience and to confirm any empirical effect.}

  abstract = {Background: At any given time, most smokers in a population are ambivalent with no motivation to quit. Motivational interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based technique that aims to elicit change in ambivalent smokers. MI practitioners are scarce and expensive, and smokers are difficult to reach. Smokers are potentially reachable through the web, and if an automated chatbot could emulate an MI conversation, it could form the basis of a low-cost and scalable intervention motivating smokers to quit. Objective: The primary goal of this study is to design, train, and test an automated MI-based chatbot capable of eliciting reflection in a conversation with cigarette smokers. This study describes the process of collecting training data to improve the chatbot's ability to generate MI-oriented responses, particularly reflections and summary statements. The secondary goal of this study is to observe the effects on participants through voluntary feedback given after completing a conversation with the chatbot. Methods: An interdisciplinary collaboration between an MI expert and experts in computer engineering and natural language processing (NLP) co-designed the conversation and algorithms underlying the chatbot. A sample of 121 adult cigarette smokers in 11 successive groups were recruited from a web-based platform for a single-arm prospective iterative design study. The chatbot was designed to stimulate reflections on the pros and cons of smoking using MI's running head start technique. Participants were also asked to confirm the chatbot's classification of their free-form responses to measure the classification accuracy of the underlying NLP models. Each group provided responses that were used to train the chatbot for the next group. Results: A total of 6568 responses from 121 participants in 11 successive groups over 14 weeks were received. From these responses, we were able to isolate 21 unique reasons for and against smoking and the relative frequency of each. The gradual collection of responses as inputs and smoking reasons as labels over the 11 iterations improved the F1 score of the classification within the chatbot from 0.63 in the first group to 0.82 in the final group. The mean time spent by each participant interacting with the chatbot was 21.3 (SD 14.0) min (minimum 6.4 and maximum 89.2). We also found that 34.7{\%} (42/121) of participants enjoyed the interaction with the chatbot, and 8.3{\%} (10/121) of participants noted explicit smoking cessation benefits from the conversation in voluntary feedback that did not solicit this explicitly. Conclusions: Recruiting ambivalent smokers through the web is a viable method to train a chatbot to increase accuracy in reflection and summary statements, the building blocks of MI. A new set of 21 smoking reasons (both for and against) has been identified. Initial feedback from smokers on the experience shows promise toward using it in an intervention.}

  abstract = {Background: Cigarette smoking poses a major public health risk. Chatbots may serve as an accessible and useful tool to promote cessation due to their high accessibility and potential in facilitating long-term personalized interactions. To increase effectiveness and acceptability, there remains a need to identify and evaluate counseling strategies for these chatbots, an aspect that has not been comprehensively addressed in previous research. Objective: This study aims to identify effective counseling strategies for such chatbots to support smoking cessation. In addition, we sought to gain insights into smokers' expectations of and experiences with the chatbot. Methods: This mixed methods study incorporated a web-based experiment and semistructured interviews. Smokers (N=229) interacted with either a motivational interviewing (MI)--style (n=112, 48.9{\%}) or a confrontational counseling--style (n=117, 51.1{\%}) chatbot. Both cessation-related (ie, intention to quit and self-efficacy) and user experience--related outcomes (ie, engagement, therapeutic alliance, perceived empathy, and interaction satisfaction) were assessed. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 16 participants, 8 (50{\%}) from each condition, and data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Results from a multivariate ANOVA showed that participants had a significantly higher overall rating for the MI (vs confrontational counseling) chatbot. Follow-up discriminant analysis revealed that the better perception of the MI chatbot was mostly explained by the user experience--related outcomes, with cessation-related outcomes playing a lesser role. Exploratory analyses indicated that smokers in both conditions reported increased intention to quit and self-efficacy after the chatbot interaction. Interview findings illustrated several constructs (eg, affective attitude and engagement) explaining people's previous expectations and timely and retrospective experience with the chatbot. Conclusions: The results confirmed that chatbots are a promising tool in motivating smoking cessation and the use of MI can improve user experience. We did not find extra support for MI to motivate cessation and have discussed possible reasons. Smokers expressed both relational and instrumental needs in the quitting process. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.}

  abstract = {Background: Motivational interviewing (MI) is a therapeutic technique that has been successful in helping smokers reduce smoking but has limited accessibility due to the high cost and low availability of clinicians. To address this, the MIBot project has sought to develop a chatbot that emulates an MI session with a client with the specific goal of moving an ambivalent smoker toward the direction of quitting. One key element of an MI conversation is reflective listening, where a therapist expresses their understanding of what the client has said by uttering a reflection that encourages the client to continue their thought process. Complex reflections link the client's responses to relevant ideas and facts to enhance this contemplation. Backward-looking complex reflections (BLCRs) link the client's most recent response to a relevant selection of the client's previous statements. Our current chatbot can generate complex reflections---but not BLCRs---using large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-2, which allows the generation of unique, human-like messages customized to client responses. Recent advancements in these models, such as the introduction of GPT-4, provide a novel way to generate complex text by feeding the models instructions and conversational history directly, making this a promising approach to generate BLCRs. Objective: This study aims to develop a method to generate BLCRs for an MI-based smoking cessation chatbot and to measure the method's effectiveness. Methods: LLMs such as GPT-4 can be stimulated to produce specific types of responses to their inputs by ``asking'' them with an English-based description of the desired output. These descriptions are called prompts, and the goal of writing a description that causes an LLM to generate the required output is termed prompt engineering. We evolved an instruction to prompt GPT-4 to generate a BLCR, given the portions of the transcript of the conversation up to the point where the reflection was needed. The approach was tested on 50 previously collected MIBot transcripts of conversations with smokers and was used to generate a total of 150 reflections. The quality of the reflections was rated on a 4-point scale by 3 independent raters to determine whether they met specific criteria for acceptability. Results: Of the 150 generated reflections, 132 (88{\%}) met the level of acceptability. The remaining 18 (12{\%}) had one or more flaws that made them inappropriate as BLCRs. The 3 raters had pairwise agreement on 80{\%} to 88{\%} of these scores. Conclusions: The method presented to generate BLCRs is good enough to be used as one source of reflections in an MI-style conversation but would need an automatic checker to eliminate the unacceptable ones. This work illustrates the power of the new LLMs to generate therapeutic client-specific responses under the command of a language-based specification.}

The interactional change processes that make MI effective have been increasingly studied using observational coding schemes. We introduce an implementation of a software-supported MI coding scheme—the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity code (MITI)—and discuss advantages for process researchers. Furthermore, we compared reliability of the software version with prior results of the paper version. A sample of 14 double-coded dyadic interactions showed good to excellent interrater reliabilities. We selected a second sample of 22 sessions to obtain convergent validity results of the software version: substantial correlations were obtained between the software instrument and the Rating Scales for the Assessment of Empathic Communication. Finally, we demonstrate how the software version can be used to test whether single code frequencies obtained by using intervals shorter than 20min (i.e., 5 or 10min) are accurate estimates of the respective code frequencies for the entire session (i.e., behavior slicing). Our results revealed that coding only a 10-min interval provides accurate estimates of the entire session. Our study demonstrates that the software implementation of the MITI is a reliable and valid instrument. We discuss advantages of the software version for process research in MI.}

Nevertheless, research assessing the technologies’ potential and risks remains sporadic. Purpose This review aims to synthesise the existing research on engagement, user attitude, and effectiveness of psychological chatbot interventions. Method A systematic review was conducted using relevant peer-reviewed literature since 2010. These studies were derived from six databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus and IEEE Xplore. Results Engagement level with chatbots that complied with digital intervention standards, lead to positive mental health outcomes. Although users had some uncertainties about the usability of these tools, positive attitudes towards chatbots regarding user experience and acceptability were frequently identified due to the chatbots' psychological capabilities and unique functions. High levels of outcome efficacy were found for those with depression. The differences in demographics, psychological approaches, and featured technologies could also influence the extent of mental health chatbot performances. Conclusion Positive attitudes and engagement with chatbots, as well as positive mental health outcomes, shows chatbot technology is a promising modality for mental health intervention. However, implementing them amongst some demographics or with novel features should be carefully considered. Further research using mainstream mental health chatbots and evaluating them simultaneously with standardised measures of engagement, user attitude, and effectiveness is necessary for intervention development.}

  abstract  = {The conversational capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest that they may be able to perform as automated talk therapists. It is crucial to know if these systems would be effective and adhere to known standards. We present a counsellor chatbot that focuses on motivating tobacco smokers to quit smoking. It uses a state-of-the-art LLM and a widely applied therapeutic approach called Motivational Interviewing (MI), and was evolved in collaboration with clinician-scientists with expertise in MI. We also describe and validate an automated assessment of both the chatbot{'}s adherence to MI and client responses. The chatbot was tested on 106 participants, and their confidence that they could succeed in quitting smoking was measured before the conversation and one week later. Participants' confidence increased by an average of 1.7 on a 0-10 scale. The automated assessment of the chatbot showed adherence to MI standards in 98{\%} of utterances, higher than human counsellors. The chatbot scored well on a participant-reported metric of perceived empathy but lower than typical human counsellors. Furthermore, participants' language indicated a good level of motivation to change, a key goal in MI. These results suggest that the automation of talk therapy with a modern LLM has promise.}

  abstract = {This study examines the use of Motivational Interviewing (MI) principles in a GPT-4-based chatbot, MIcha, to promote behaviour change. We conducted a pre-registered randomised controlled trial to assess the integration of MI techniques in conversational agents, aiming to support users’ behaviour change through guided self-reflection and identify how users interact with large language model (LLM)-based systems in this context. Results indicate that short conversations with LLM-based chatbots are successful at increasing users’ readiness to change and usage of MI principles during text generation can effectively mitigate potential harms. Additionally, we identified distinct user behaviour types — cooperative, reflective, and pre-informed—that significantly influenced the outcomes of interactions. These findings demonstrate the potential of MI principles in enhancing the efficacy of conversational agents for behaviour change and highlight the importance of user behaviour in shaping interaction dynamics.}

  abstract  = {Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted the need for robust, comprehensive, and challenging benchmarks. Yet, research on evaluating their Emotional Intelligence (EI) is considerably limited. Existing benchmarks have two major shortcomings: first, they mainly focus on emotion recognition, neglecting essential EI capabilities such as emotion management and thought facilitation through emotion understanding; second, they are primarily constructed from existing datasets, which include frequent patterns, explicit information, and annotation errors, leading to unreliable evaluation. We propose EmoBench, a benchmark that draws upon established psychological theories and proposes a comprehensive definition for machine EI, including Emotional Understanding and Emotional Application. EmoBench includes a set of 400 hand-crafted questions in English and Chinese, which are meticulously designed to require thorough reasoning and understanding. Our findings reveal a considerable gap between the EI of existing LLMs and the average human, highlighting a promising direction for future research. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/Sahandfer/EmoBench.}

In this paper, we explore several linguistic aspects of the collaboration process occurring during counseling conversations. Specifically, we address the differences between high-quality and low-quality counseling. Our approach examines participants' turn-by-turn interaction, their linguistic alignment, the sentiment expressed by speakers during the conversation, as well as the different topics being discussed. Our results suggest important language differences in low- and high-quality counseling, which we further use to derive linguistic features able to capture the differences between the two groups. These features are then used to build automatic classifiers that can predict counseling quality with accuracies of up to 88{\%}.}

This study explored how third parties evaluated AI-generated empathetic responses versus human responses in terms of compassion, responsiveness, and overall preference across four preregistered experiments. Participants (N{\thinspace}={\thinspace}556) read empathy prompts describing valenced personal experiences and compared the AI responses to select non-expert or expert humans. Results revealed that AI responses were preferred and rated as more compassionate compared to select human responders (Study 1). This pattern of results remained when author identity was made transparent (Study 2), when AI was compared to expert crisis responders (Study 3), and when author identity was disclosed to all participants (Study 4). Third parties perceived AI as being more responsive---conveying understanding, validation, and care---which partially explained AI's higher compassion ratings in Study 4. These findings suggest that AI has robust utility in contexts requiring empathetic interaction, with the potential to address the increasing need for empathy in supportive communication contexts.}

  abstract = {Despite the demonstrated efficacy of disease modifying therapies (DMT), many MS patients (~ 40%) stop using DMT within 3 years of starting. A cross-over randomized controlled trial demonstrated that a theoretically based motivational interviewing- cognitive behavior therapy (MI-CBT) intervention increased DMT re-initiation among relapsing-remitting MS patients compared to a treatment as usual (TAU) condition. This study explored the mechanisms of action responsible for the effectiveness of the MI-CBT intervention.Following baseline assessment, participants (N=91; 85.7% female) were randomly assigned to receive either five sessions of MI-CBT or to treatment as usual with brief education. Potential mediators were two broad measures of motivation (a single item motivation “ruler” and the Brief Motivation Scale; BMS), autonomous motivation, personal control, treatment control, and confidence to re-initiate). They were assessed at baseline and end of treatment (week 10) using established measures.Log-binomial regression mediation examining each mediator separately revealed that the strongest mediators were the motivation ruler and BMS. The intervention was associated with an estimated 20% increase in probability of positive outcome through its effect on the motivation ruler and an estimated 24% increase of positive outcome through its effect on BMS. In exploratory regression analyses that examined each of the mediators as predictors of DMT (re-) initiation in a comprehensive logistic regression model, the only significant predictor in the model was the BMS change variable. A second logistic regression model in which the Brief Motivation Scale change predictor variable was removed, revealed that the motivation ruler and the personal control change variable were significant predictors of (re-) initiation.An important implication of this study is that the MI-CBT intervention appeared to work primarily by increasing motivation rather than by increasing confidence. This study also highlights the importance of personal control in promoting DMT re-initiation and the need for future studies to investigate other interventions to promote personal control in patients with MS.},

  abstract = {Implementing empathy to healthcare chatbots is considered promising to create a sense of human warmth. However, existing research frequently overlooks the multidimensionality of empathy, leading to an insufficient understanding if artificial empathy is perceived similarly to interpersonal empathy. This paper argues that implementing experiential expressions of empathy may have unintended negative consequences as they might feel inauthentic. Instead, providing instrumental support could be more suitable for modeling artificial empathy as it aligns better with computer-like schemas towards chatbots. Two experimental studies using healthcare chatbots examine the effect of empathetic (feeling with), sympathetic (feeling for), and behavioral-empathetic (empathetic helping) vs. non-empathetic responses on perceived warmth, perceived authenticity, and their consequences on trust and using intentions. Results reveal that any kind of empathy (vs. no empathy) enhances perceived warmth resulting in higher trust and using intentions. As hypothesized, empathetic, and sympathetic responses reduce the chatbot's perceived authenticity suppressing this positive effect in both studies. A third study does not replicate this backfiring effect in human-human interactions. This research thus highlights that empathy does not equally apply to human-bot interactions. It further introduces the concept of ‘perceived authenticity’ and demonstrates that distinctively human attributes might backfire by feeling inauthentic in interactions with chatbots.}

The system generates counselors{'}reflections {--} i.e., responses that reflect back on what the client has said given the dialogue history. Our method builds upon the new generative pretrained transformer architecture and enhances it with context augmentation techniques inspired by traditional strategies used during counselor training. Through a set of comparative experiments, we show that the system that incorporates these strategies performs better in the reflection generation task than a system that is just fine-tuned with counseling conversations. To confirm our findings, we present a human evaluation study that shows that our system generates naturally-looking reflections that are also stylistically and grammatically correct.}

  abstract  = {We consider the task of building a dialogue system that can motivate users to adopt positive lifestyle changes, Motivational Interviewing (MI). Addressing such a task requires a system that could infer \textit{how} to motivate the user effectively. We propose DIIR, a framework that is capable of learning and applying conversation strategies in the form of natural language inductive rules from expert demonstrations. Automatic and human evaluation on instruction-following large language models show natural language strategies descriptions discovered by DIIR can improve active listening skills, reduce unsolicited advice, and promote more collaborative and less authoritative conversations, outperforming in-context demonstrations that are over 50 times longer.}
