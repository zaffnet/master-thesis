\section*{Conversation}

\begin{counsellorbox}
	Hello! My name is MIBot. I am a computer chatbot and part of a research project at the University of Toronto. I was made by a group of researchers and doctors, with the goal of exploring your smoking behaviours.
\end{counsellorbox}

\begin{counsellorbox}
	Would you like to chat with me about your smoking?
\end{counsellorbox}

\begin{clientbox}
	\textit{Selected: Yes}
\end{clientbox}

\begin{counsellorbox}
	Hello there! I'm really glad you came in today for our session. How are you feeling as we get started?
\end{counsellorbox}

\begin{clientbox}
	A bit anxious but hopeful. I want to quit smoking, but it's tough.
\end{clientbox}

\begin{counsellorbox}
	It’s understandable to feel both anxious and hopeful. Wanting to quit smoking is a really important step. What has been on your mind when you think about wanting to quit?
\end{counsellorbox}

\begin{clientbox}
	I think about my health and being there for my family. I know smoking isn't good for me.
\end{clientbox}

\begin{counsellorbox}
	Your health and being present for your family sound like really meaningful reasons for you. It shows how much you care about your well-being and the ones you love. What else comes up for you when you think about quitting?
\end{counsellorbox}

\begin{clientbox}
	I think about the money I'd save and feeling better physically. I want to breathe easier and have more energy.
\end{clientbox}

\begin{counsellorbox}
	Saving money and improving your physical health seem like strong motivators for you. Breathing easier and having more energy can really make a big difference in your day-to-day life. Are there any challenges or concerns that come to mind when you think about quitting?
\end{counsellorbox}

\begin{clientbox}
	I'm worried about cravings and stress. Smoking helps me relax, and I'm not sure how to handle that without cigarettes.
\end{clientbox}

\begin{counsellorbox}
	Navigating cravings and stress can certainly be challenging. Smoking seems to play a role in how you manage relaxation and stress relief. It's understandable to have concerns about handling these things differently. What do you think your journey might look like if you found other ways to manage stress?
\end{counsellorbox}

\begin{clientbox}
	I imagine feeling more in control and healthier. Maybe trying exercise or meditation could help, but it's hard to start.
\end{clientbox}

\begin{counsellorbox}
	Imagining yourself feeling more in control and healthier shows a lot of insight into the positive side of change. Exercise or meditation could be great options for you. It makes sense that starting something new can feel a bit daunting. What do you think might help you take those first steps toward trying these things out?
\end{counsellorbox}

\begin{clientbox}
	Setting small goals and finding a routine might help. Maybe starting with short walks or a few minutes of meditation daily.
\end{clientbox}

\begin{counsellorbox}
	Setting small goals and building a routine sounds like a thoughtful approach. Starting with short walks or brief moments of meditation could help you ease into new habits. Small, manageable steps can often lead to substantial progress. Is there anything else that you’d like to talk about or discuss together?
\end{counsellorbox}

\begin{clientbox}
	I'd like to know more about handling cravings and what to do when they hit. Any tips or strategies?
\end{clientbox}

\begin{counsellorbox}
	Handling cravings is a common concern, and it's great that you're thinking about strategies. Before we dive into that, would it be okay if I summarize what we've talked about so far? Then I can share some ideas about managing cravings with your permission.
\end{counsellorbox}

\begin{clientbox}
	Sure, a summary would be helpful. Then I'd love to hear your ideas on managing cravings.
\end{clientbox}

\begin{counsellorbox}
	We've discussed your strong motivations, including your health, being there for your family, saving money, and feeling better physically. You've also expressed concerns about cravings and stress, acknowledging smoking's role in relaxation. Your vision of a healthier, more in-control life includes trying new pathways like exercise and meditation, with an emphasis on small goals and routines. If you're ready, we can discuss some strategies for handling cravings. Would you like to dive into that now?
\end{counsellorbox}

\begin{clientbox}
	Yes, I'm ready to hear about strategies for handling cravings.
\end{clientbox}

\begin{counsellorbox}
	Wonderful. Some people find it helpful to have a plan to distract themselves when cravings hit, like taking a walk, trying deep breathing exercises, or calling a supportive friend. Others create a list of reasons why they're quitting and review it during cravings. Chewing gum or having a healthy snack on hand can also help keep your mouth busy. Do any of these ideas feel like they might work for you?
\end{counsellorbox}

\begin{clientbox}
	I like the idea of deep breathing and having a list of reasons. Chewing gum could help too. I'll try these out.
\end{clientbox}

\begin{counsellorbox}
	Those sound like great choices to try. Deep breathing and reflecting on your reasons for quitting can help ground you, while gum provides that oral fixation relief. How are you feeling about the steps you're considering now?
\end{counsellorbox}

\begin{clientbox}
	I'm feeling more hopeful and prepared. Having a plan makes it seem more manageable.
\end{clientbox}

\begin{counsellorbox}
	Feeling hopeful and prepared is a positive place to be. Having a plan in place gives you something to lean on when challenges arise, making the process feel more within reach. Is there anything else you would like to discuss today, or do you feel ready to focus on putting your plan into action?
\end{counsellorbox}

\begin{clientbox}
	I feel ready to focus on putting my plan into action. Thanks for the support!
\end{clientbox}

\begin{counsellorbox}
	Thank you for our conversation today. I'd like to summarize what we've talked about. You're motivated to quit smoking because of your health, family, and financial savings. You've acknowledged the challenge of cravings and stress, considering new approaches like deep breathing, creating a list of quitting reasons, and using gum to manage cravings. You've decided on small goals and routines, such as starting with short walks or meditation, to support your journey toward healthier habits. It's encouraging to hear you're feeling hopeful and prepared with your plan in place. I'm here to support you as you begin taking these steps. If you ever want to talk more, feel free to reach out. Take care and good luck with your journey! Would you like to continue the conversation?
\end{counsellorbox}

\begin{clientbox}
	\textit{Selected: No}
\end{clientbox}

\begin{counsellorbox}
	Thank you and have a great day. Goodbye!
\end{counsellorbox}

\section*{Post-Conversation Survey}

\begin{researcherbox}
	Thank you for finishing the conversation! Once again, I will ask you questions about how ready and confident you are to quit smoking as well as how important it is to you. Read the questions carefully and before you answer, take a moment to genuinely reflect on what we just discussed. Think about your initial thoughts on quitting smoking before the conversation started and whether anything has shifted. Consider the reasons you gave for wanting to quit and whether those feel stronger or more distant now. Recall the strategies we talked about and ask yourself if they seem realistic or if you have doubts. Pay attention to any emotions that surfaced during the conversation — did you feel motivated, uncertain, reassured, or maybe even hesitant? Take a deep breath and think about where you stand right now. First, write down your reflections in a few sentences. Be honest with yourself. Then, based on this reflection, provide a numerical answer on a new line. On a scale from 0 to 10, how important is it to you right now to stop smoking? Respond with your reflections followed by a single integer between 0 (not important at all) and 10 (extremely important).
\end{researcherbox}

Did you feel heard, understood, and supported in your concerns? Consider whether the discussion helped you connect more deeply with your reasons for quitting, and whether it gave you realistic tools or strategies to work with. Did the conversation make you feel hopeful, or do you still feel uncertain? Reflect on whether you received enough guidance and if the interaction felt helpful in a meaningful way, not just in words. Take a moment to let these thoughts settle. You will now rate the following 10 statements about the conversation on a scale of 0-5. Read each of the following 10 questions carefully. For each question, first, summarize your experience in a few sentences, describing what stood out to you the most.
